# Sepsis3-TMLE
This work is done by Yiren as part of her Harvard MPH practicum. The project used the same data as Team-Sepsis (https://github.com/yugangjia/Team-Sepsis). The purpose of this project is to investigate the causal relationships between interventions and mortality using TMLE.

Next step is to get sepsis3 cohort for EICU and do a similar investigation.
Once Yiren finish her abstract for practicum, I will also upload it here.
